    <h1>What’s a Stock Bit?</h1>
    <p>A Stock Bit is a piece of a single share of stock, otherwise known as a fractional share. When you buy a Stock Bit, you specify a dollar amount that you’d like to spend instead of a number of shares. Pretty handy when you’re interested in the pricier stocks that can cost several hundreds or even thousands of dollars for one share. Now you can get a piece for as little as $5.</p>

<h1>Why do you offer Stock Bits?</h1>
    <p>We want investors to be in as much control as possible. Stock Bits, or fractional shares, lets investors choose how much or how little to invest in a particular stock or ETF. Stock Bits allows you to invest in what you know and love at your comfort level. It’s also a great way to test the market and learn about stocks and ETFs without committing to purchasing entire shares. At SoFi we’re big believers in growth mindset.</p>
<br>
<h1>Fractional Buying</h1>
<b><p>How do I buy a Stock Bit?</p></b>
<p>If a stock is available to buy a Bit, then you’ll see an option to choose to buy in dollars rather than in shares. Make sure the dollars option is selected and then enter an amount—as little as $5.Browse Stock Bits</p>
<b><p>I bought a Stock Bit, but the order hasn’t gone through yet. What happened?</p></b>
<p>SoFi has two ways it fills fractional share purchases. During trading hours orders are submitted and filled immediately. When the market is closed either during after-hours trading, weekends, or holidays SoFi queues orders and executes them in a batch when the security begins trading. Since there’s a delay between placing your order and SoFi completing the buy if you place the trade during after-hours trading, weekends or holidays, the price of the stock might change, meaning the size of your share could also change. If you need to cancel the trade, you can do so from the ‘Activity’ section of the app, up until it is completed.</p>

<b><p>What happens if I place a buy and sell for the same amount for the same stock?</p></b>
<p>You do you, we won’t judge. But if you buy and then sell, both orders will still go through; they won’t cancel each other out. If the buy hasn’t gone through yet, though, you can cancel it from the ‘Activity’ section of the app</p>

<b><p>Can I buy Stock Bits from any company?</p></b>
<p>We have real-time fractional trading available on over 4,500 securities. However, not all stocks and ETFs are currently available in Stock Bits. If a stock is available to buy a fraction of, then you’ll see an option to choose to buy in dollars rather than in shares.Stock Bits are available based on demand, so this list can definitely change.</p>

<b><p>Can I combine a limit order with a Stock Bit?</p></b>
<p>Nope, we only offer market orders of Stock Bits.</p>

<b><p>Why is my order not for the exact amount that I specified?</p></b>
<p>If you placed an order for $500, for example, and you got $499.99 or 500.01 instead, it’s because we only divide shares up to 5 decimal places. Consequently, your order might execute for a penny more or less than what you entered.</p>

<h1>Fractional Selling</h1>
<b><p>Can I sell a fraction of my Stock Bit?</p></b>
<p>You can sell any amount you’d like, but the smallest denomination we support is up to 5 decimal places. In fact, if the fraction is super small, there is a possibility that we won’t be able to execute the trade due to market movement. For example, if the price of a stock drops at all, though, a $0.00001 sale could end up failing to execute. But that’s an edge case. For example, if you are trying to sell a small fraction of a share and the market moves downward, the sale amount could be less than a penny which would cause the trade to be canceled.</p>

<b><p>What happens when I sell in dollars?</p></b>
<p>If you make a sale in dollars, SoFi converts that into a fraction of a share. So the amount of money that you get for the sale reflects a portion of the price of the share at the time that the sale goes through. In other words, because sales happen daily rather than in real time, if you sell $100 of a stock, the dollar amount that you receive for the sale might not be exactly $100 due to market movement.</p>

<b><p>What happens when I sell in shares?</p></b>
<p>Your order enters into a queue along with other fractional trades. SoFi, then executes all fractional trades in a batch in the market and allocates those shares to participants of that order.</p>
